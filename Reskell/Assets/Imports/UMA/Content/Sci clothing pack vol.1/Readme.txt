To use these assets, this folder will need to be 
added to the global library. 

Open the Global Library window from the UMA menu, 
and drag the containing folder onto the global 
library window where it says "Drag indexable assets here."

This will index the assets so they can be used in any scene.

To test, open the "UMA DCS Demo - Simple Setup" scene that
comes with the base UMA install, press Run, and you should 
be able to add the assets to the Avatar.
